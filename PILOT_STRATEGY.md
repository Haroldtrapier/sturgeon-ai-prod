Hi [First Name],

I’m reaching out from Sturgeon AI, a government contracting intelligence and proposal production platform designed specifically for federal agencies and contractors.

**The Problem We Solve:**  
Manual proposal prep, missed compliance requirements, and fragmented submission workflows slow down contracting and increase risk.

**What We Built:**  
A FedRAMP-aligned system that:
- Extracts SHALL/MUST requirements automatically
- Generates compliant proposal sections
- Tracks compliance with audit trails
- Exports submission-ready packages (DOCX/ZIP)

**Why I’m Reaching Out:**  
We’re offering a limited **90-day pilot** to [Agency Name] to validate outcomes with your team. No cost, full platform access, and we provide the security documentation your ISSO needs.

**What We’re Looking For:**
- 5–10 users willing to test the platform
- Bi-weekly feedback
- Metrics sharing (time saved, error reduction)

**Next Step:**  
Would you be open to a 20-minute intro call next week? I can walk you through the platform and share our security pack.

Best,
