## 📊 PRICING RATIONALE

### Why This Structure?

**Starter ($99/mo):**
- **Captures hobbyists/explorers** without cannibalizing Pro
- **Low friction entry point** (credit card, self-service)
- **Upsell path clear** (proposal generator locked behind Pro)

**Pro ($399/mo):**
- **Sweet spot for small GovCon firms** ($4,788/year)
- **Comparable to existing tools** (GovWin, Deltek are $500–$2k/year)
- **Price anchored to value:** Saves 20+ hours/proposal × $100/hr = $2k+ value
- **High margin** (low COGS, SaaS economics)

**Enterprise (Custom):**
- **Captures agencies, primes, regulated buyers**
- **Price on outcomes:** Risk reduction, audit compliance, time savings
- **Security/ATO consulting justifies premium**
- **Annual contracts reduce churn**
